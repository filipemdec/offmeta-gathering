# offmeta-gathering 🌿⛏️

A clean and user-friendly **QBCore** gathering system where players simply walk up to a resource spot and press **E** to collect.

✨ **Highlights**
- ⌨️ **Press E to gather** (no complicated menus — just get close and go!)
- 🎬 **Progressbar + animation** for a more immersive feel
- 🎁 **ItemBox + right-side notifications** showing what you collected
- ⚙️ Easy-to-tweak **config.lua** with friendly instructions
- 🔁 Optional **qb-target** support (if you prefer targets over keypress)

💡 Perfect for: **mining, woodcutting, harvesting, scavenging** and any other “walk up and collect” gameplay loops.

🙏 **Credit**
- Based on **qb-gathering**, with improvements and polishing by **OFFMETA**.
